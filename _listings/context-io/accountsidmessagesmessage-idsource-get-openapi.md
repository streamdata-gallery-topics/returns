  title: Context.IO Get Accounts Messages Message Source
  description: 'Fetches the message source. Returns the raw RFC-822 message source
    for the message (including attachments) with no parsing or decoding to any portions
    of the message. On-demand data retrieval: since we do not keep full copies of
    emails on our servers, this call triggers a connection to the IMAP server to fetch
    the message. Attachments are part of the message source so they will impact how
    fast this call responds.'
